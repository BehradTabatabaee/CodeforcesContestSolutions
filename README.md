# radicalCodeForcesTraining
so here's the thing: i finished reading the first volume of the competitive programming 4 book and re-studied number theory and essential math, so hypothetically i should be good enough to reach a rating of at least 1600-1800 in codeforces, meaning i should be able to solve the first 3 problem of a div2 contest and the first 4 problems in a div4 contest in a good amount of time, but i'm unable to do that. so i'll just solve keep solving the first 3 problems of div2 and the first 4 problems of div4 contests. the goal is to do this for the first page of the codeforces contests till the end of this week (2 days?) and keep doing it for another week to really solidify my place as a 1600-1800 competitive programmer. i'll be solving as many contests as i can, which should be helpful in getting better at solving problems. this is essentially equivalent to trying to brute-force my way through questions that i'm currently unable to solve, which is not recommended and might be seen as an extremely radical approach to getting good, but it is what has always worked best for me so i'll just keep doing it till i feel comfortable with myself
