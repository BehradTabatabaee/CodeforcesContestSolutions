# radicalCodeForcesTraining
so here's the thing: i finished reading the first volume of the competitive programming 4 book and re-studied number theory and essential math, so hypothetically i should be good enough to reach a rating of at least 1600-1800 in codeforces, meaning i should be able to solve the first 3 problem of a div2 contest and the first 4 problems in a div4 contest in a good amount of time, but i'm unable to do that. so i'll just solve keep solving the first 3 problems of div2 and the first 4 problems of div4 contests.
the idea is to find 20 contests, 10 div3 and 10 div2, and solve them in this order:


1. div3 A-B-C
2. div2 A-B
3. div2 C
4. div3 D


which will hopefully allow me to solve the first 3 problems in a div2 contest. since the plan is to finish this in a week, it might come off as an extremely stupid and radical approach to getting better at CP, but it is what has always worked best for me and this time, too, is probably no exception.
