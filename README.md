# radicalCodeForcesTraining
so here's the thing: i finished reading the first volume of the competitive programming 4 book and re-studied number theory and essential math, so hypothetically i should be good enough to reach a rating of at 1600-1800 in codeforces, meaning i should be able to solve the first 3 problem of a div2 contest and the first 4 problems in a div4 contest in a good amount of time, but i'm unable to do that. so i'll just solve the first 3 problems of div2 and 4 problems of div4 contests that i come across. the goal is to do this for the first page of the codeforces contests till the end of this week (2 days?) and keep doing it for another week to really solidify my place as a 1600-1800 competitive programmer. i'll at most solve 20 contests (div2 and div3), and since there is roughly 3 div2 contests for each div3 one, it'll amount to something around ~70-75 problems, which should be a good starting point.
